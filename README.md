# Anime-Data-Analysis

## Premise
This project will feature the visualization of trends between anime-associated variables, such as genre, score, popularity, rating, etc. There are 2 reasons why I endeavoured on this project: to sharpen up my data science skills and to do a coding project in a subject I enjoyed. 

Note: CSV has a mistake - Type = "Mu" should be "Music" - can easily be fixed in postprocessing
