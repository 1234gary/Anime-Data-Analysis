# Anime-Data-Analysis

## Premise
This project will feature the visualization of trends between anime-associated variables, such as genre, score, popularity, rating, etc. There are 2 reasons why I endeavoured on this project: to sharpen up my data science skills and to do a coding project in a subject I enjoyed. 

Note: CSV has a mistake - Type = "Mu" should be "Music" - can easily be fixed in postprocessing

Current Ideas:

Time Evolution: How have scores / seasons / genres changed over year (or even season to season)?

Studio Significance : Which studios have the most success (popularity and rating) with which genres?

The LN Mystery: Do LNs tend to be rated lower?

The CGDCT Mystery: Do CGDCT SOLs tend to be rated lower?

Can we predict the ranking and popularity of a anime based on studio, genres, source type?

Might stick this onto a website later.
